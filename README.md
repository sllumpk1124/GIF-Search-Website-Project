Welcome to the GIF Search Application! This simple web application allows users to search for GIFs using the GIPHY API and display them dynamically on the page.

## Features

- **Display GIFs:** The retrieved GIFs are displayed on the page. Each GIF is limited to a maximum size of 250px wide and 200px high.

- **Remove GIFs:** Each displayed GIF comes with a "Remove" button beside it. Click the button to remove the corresponding GIF from the page.

2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

4. View the retrieved GIFs on the page. Click the "Remove" button beside each GIF to remove it.
